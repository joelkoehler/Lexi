Name: Joel Koehler
Class: CS472 (Object-Oriented Design Patterns)
Instructor: Jim B.
Assignment: HW4 - Lexi

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
$ javac *.java
$ LexiWindow="x" LexiWidget="y" java Lexi
    (where x is either "Swing" or "Awt", and y is either "Red" or "Green")

WHAT I ADDED:
I added Bridge(151) and used AbstractFactory(87) and FactoryMethod(107) again, 
though in a slightly different way (Bridge(151)'s RefinedAbstraction interacts 
with AbstractFactory(87)'s AbstractFactory).

WHAT I GOT STUCK ON:
I had issues with draw, where seemingly randow UI elements would be colored. 
Sometimes is was the button/label I wanted to be colored, and other times it was
a glyph they contained. Sometimes no color would show up at all, and sometimes 
I got a null pointer from _graphics. It was all very inconsistent. I fixed it by
only allowing the concrete products (concrete windows) to call draw. This makes
sense because the higher levels of abstraction should not have to deal with it.

NOTE:
I split my UML into two halves since I don't have paper big enough to include
everything in one view and still have it be clear enough to read.
