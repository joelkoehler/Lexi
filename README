Name: Joel Koehler
Class: CS472 (Object-Oriented Design Patterns)
Instructor: Jim B.
Assignment: HW2 - Lexi

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
$ javac *.java
$ java Lexi

WHAT I ADDED:
I used the Decorator pattern to add scrollbars and borders. I also refactored my HW1
code to better fit OO practices.

WHAT I GOT STUCK ON:
The code base is getting so large that it was difficult for me to understand how it
all fits together now. I understand it conceptually, but tracing method calls is much more
confusing in Object Oriented. I had a lot of issues with bounds and sizing as well.

SCREENSHOT:
I took a screenshot of the example in Lexi.java. I have several tests in Lexi.java
to demonstrate iterative feature development.
