Name: Joel Koehler
Class: CS472 (Object-Oriented Design Patterns)
Instructor: Jim B.
Assignment: HW3 - Lexi

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
$ javac *.java
$ java Lexi

WHAT I ADDED:
I used AbstractFactory, FactoryMethod, and Singleton patterns.

WHAT I GOT STUCK ON:
The interaction of the AbstractFactory and Singleton patterns is 
what I spent the most time on for this homework. The concept of 
a singleton calling a constructor made no sense in an Abstract Class,
so figuring out how to get it to play nice with the subclasses was key.
This homework went the best of any so far, so that's encouraging. 

ISSUES:
I had to hardcode "green" or "red" in GUIFactory in order for this to run for me.
I have noted this in the code (line 15/16 of GUIFactory).
